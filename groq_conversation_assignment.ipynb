Analysis & Recommendations\n","=======================================================\n","📊 Current Performance Analysis:\n","==============================\n","📈 Current Parameter Performance:\n","   • Average messages per conversation: 5.7\n","   • Average characters per conversation: 1353\n","   • Truncation trigger rate: 17.6%\n","   • Summarization efficiency: 1 summaries created\n","\n","🎯 FINE-TUNING RECOMMENDATIONS:\n","===================================\n","🔷 For Customer Service (High Detail Need):\n","   • max_turns=12-15 (longer context needed)\n","   • max_chars=2000-2500 (detailed explanations)\n","   • summarize_every=5 (less frequent, preserve detail)\n","\n","🔷 For Information Collection (Current Use Case):\n","   • max_turns=8-10 ✅ (current setting good)\n","   • max_chars=1500-2000 (slightly increase for complex forms)\n","   • summarize_every=3-4 ✅ (current setting optimal)\n","\n","🔷 For High-Volume Chat Support:\n","   • max_turns=6-8 (memory efficiency priority)\n","   • max_chars=1000-1200 (aggressive truncation)\n","   • summarize_every=2-3 (frequent summarization)\n","\n","🔷 For Technical Documentation:\n","   • max_turns=15-20 (detailed technical context)\n","   • max_chars=3000-4000 (code examples, explanations)\n","   • summarize_every=4-6 (preserve technical details)\n","\n","💰 COST OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS:\n","==============================\n","💸 Current Cost Efficiency:\n","   • Estimated tokens per conversation: 338\n","   • Estimated cost per conversation: $0.0169\n","   • Daily cost for 100 conversations: $1.69\n","\n","🎯 Cost Optimization Recommendations:\n","   • For budget-conscious: Reduce max_chars to 1000\n","   • For quality-focused: Increase to 2000 (better context)\n","   • For balanced approach: Keep current 1500 ✅\n","\n","⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:\n","==============================\n","🔹 Response Time Optimization:\n","   • Shorter conversations = faster processing\n","   • Current 8-turn limit provides good balance\n","   • Consider reducing to 6 turns for real-time chat\n","\n","🔹 Memory Usage Optimization:\n","   • Current summarization every 3 conversations is efficient\n","   • For memory-constrained systems: summarize every 2\n","   • For high-detail needs: summarize every 4-5\n","\n","🔧 RECOMMENDED PRODUCTION
